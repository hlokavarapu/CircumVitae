%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TURN OFF BibTeX? %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% If there is no need for BibTeX in this document turn it off, since it creates unwanted 
% files.

\let\nobibtex = t

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SET UP PAGE PARAMETERS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% EGP's preferred page style for notes, homework assignments, exams, etc.

% Margins, paragraph indents, space between paragraphs if any, etc. Good references 
% include page 85 of "The LaTeX Companion" by Frank Mittelbach and Michel Goossens and 
% page 260 of "Math Into LaTeX" by George Gratzer.

% Enlarge the width and height of the printed page

\setlength{\textwidth }{7.50 in}
\setlength{\textheight}{9.50 in} % \textheight     = 9.25 in

% Space between the end of the odd and even side margins and the beginning of the text.

\setlength{\oddsidemargin }{0.0 in}
\setlength{\evensidemargin}{0.0 in}

% The side margins are 1.0 inch plus \hoffset and the top margins is 1.0 inch plus 
% \voffset. According to "The LaTeX Companion" the default values are \hoffset = 00 pt 
% and \voffset = 00 pt.

\setlength{\hoffset}{-0.50 in}
\setlength{\voffset}{-0.50 in}

% If there is no header in this document, set each of the following values to zero.

% This is the amount of space between the BOTTOM of the HEAD and the TOP of the BODY. 
% According to "Math Into LaTeX"  by George Gratzer the default values for LaTeX's 
% article document is \headsep = 25 pt.

\setlength{\headsep}{12 pt}

% Package Fancyhdr Warning: \headheight = 12 pt is too small. Make it at least 14.0pt. 
% According to "Math Into LaTeX"  by George Gratzer the default value for LaTeX's article 
% document is \headheight = 12 pt.

\setlength{\headheight}{14 pt}

% This is the amount of space between the top of the page and the TOP of the header. According to "Math
% Into LaTeX"  by George Gratzer the default value for LaTeX's article document is \topmargin = 16 pt.
% \headheight = 12pt, and .

\setlength{\topmargin }{00 pt}

% This is the amount of space between the TOP OF THE BODY and THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRST 
% line of text on the page. According to "Math Into LaTeX" by George Gratzer the default
% value for LaTeX's article documents is \topskip = ?? pt.

\setlength{\topskip}{12 pt}

% This is the amount of space between the last line on the page and the footer. According 
% to "The LaTeX Companion" and "Math Into LaTeX" the default value is \footskip = 30 pt.

\setlength{\footskip}{18 pt}

% I like space between paragraphs, since it makes the document more readable. However, 
% this does not seem to change the spacing between paragraphs contained in an item of a 
% list.

\setlength{\parskip}{12 pt} % default: \parskip        = 12  pt

% Comment out the following line to use the default amount to indent the first line of 
% each paragraph.

\setlength{\parindent}{00 pt}

% Add an underline of text that breaks the line properly with \uline{text} ...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LOAD THE "enumitem" PACKAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{enumitem}

% \setenumerate[1]{labelindent=0pt,itemindent=12pt}

\setlength{\labelwidth}{00 pt}
\setlength{\leftmargin}{0.0in}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Set Up The "Version" Package %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This environment allows one to include text in the LaTeX file that is not printed when it
% is compiled.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LOAD AMS LaTeX Packages %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 

% Using the "amsart" or "amsbook" document class instead of the standard LaTeX "article"
% document class provides all (or at least most) of the AMS math macros. However, it also
% puts a colon in the description list environment, which I don't like.

\usepackage{amsthm}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsfonts}

% Added by EGP for script fonts such as script L for a linear operator: \mathscr{L}

\usepackage[mathscr]{euscript}

% This package provides an arrow \longrightarrow, that is longer than AMSMATH's
% \xrightarrow and \xrightarrow.

\usepackage{extarrows} % (extensible arrows)



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SET UP THE "VERSION" PACKAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This environment allows one to include text in the LaTeX file that is not printed when % it is compiled

% CAUTION: Do not use "space" as the name of a version environment, since it causes problems with LaTeX's memory

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LOAD THE HYPERREF PACKAGE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The basic usage with the standard settings is straightforward. Just load the package in 
% the preamble, at the end of all the other packages but prior to other settings.

% From the `Introduction' to the hyperref manual: Make sure it comes last of your loaded 
% packages, to give it a fighting chance of not being over-written, since its job is to 
% redefine many LATEX commands. Hopefully you will find that all cross-references work 
% correctly as hypertext. For example, \section commands will produce a bookmark and a 
% link, whereas \section* commands will only show links when paired with a corresponding 
% \addcontentsline command.

% I think the default values for "bookmarks" is 'false' and for "bookmarksopen" is 'false'
